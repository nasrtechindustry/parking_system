## SMART PARKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
   1. Introduction
        Efficient parking management is essential in urban areas where space is limited, and the demand for
        parking is high. Traditional systems often rely on manual processes, which can lead to errors,
        inefficiencies, and frustration for both users and administrators. To address these challenges, the Parking
        Management System is designed as a modern, automated solution 

    2. System Design and Architecture
        The Parking Management System is structured into three primary components:
        Frontend: The GUI, developed using Tkinter, provides an intuitive interface for administrators and
        users. It features login screens, dashboards, and modules for reservations, payment processing, and slot
        availability monitoring.
        Backend: MySQL serves as the backend database, storing user information, reservation data, payment
        records, and parking slot statuses. The relational database model ensures data normalization and avoids
        redundancy.

    3. Implementation Details
        3.1. Technologies Used
            Programming Language: Python 3
            Frontend Library: Tkinter
            Database Management System: sqlite3 with SQLALchemy
            Tools and Frameworks: XAMPP , VsCODE , SQLITE view

        3.2. Key Features
            Authenticating the user by allowing only the operator | admin
            Add Vehicle and Customer Management;
            Slot Management;
            Reservation management;

# How To start

        ```      
    3. create virtual environment
        ```bash
            python3 -m venv venv
        ```
    4. activate your virtual environment 
        # on mac and linux distribution
        ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
        ```

        # on windows
            
            ```bash
